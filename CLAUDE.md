# TARMAC — House Rules

## 1. Project Identity

TARMAC is a **research and design project for Aviation 2.0** — a data-driven upgrade plan
for the air transportation network, applicable at international, national, regional, and
local scales. The mission: score an existing network against a calibrated dimension pool,
find the gaps (congestion/delay, lost connectivity, single-runway fragility, fortress-hub
fares, weak intermodal access, eroded small-community service, tier-SLA shortfalls), and
design into them.

**The architectural bet** — borrowed from ROUTE/PYLON/GAUGE/BASIN/PACKET: score enough of
an existing network on enough dimensions and the design space tells you its own structure.
The gaps aren't invented; they're found. A project designed into a real gap is better
evidence than one invented from first principles.

**The testable hypothesis**: there is a set of ≤20 interventions — at a stated scale —
that, if built or adopted to Aviation 2.0 standards, would relieve delay, restore
connectivity, and reduce access inequity. **A rigorous null result is as valid as a
positive one.** Silent scope expansion to rescue a failing hypothesis is not acceptable.

Sibling projects: **ROUTE** (highways), **PYLON** (grid), **GAUGE** (rail), **BASIN**
(water), **PACKET** (internet). TARMAC borrows their structural patterns; TARMAC's own
rules apply here.

## 2. Multi-Scale Rule

Every corpus element carries a **scale** (`international` / `national` / `regional` /
`local`) and a market/jurisdiction. Scores, tiers, gaps, and design proposals are
interpreted **within their stated scale**. A claim must not compare or aggregate across
scales without saying so. The same dimension pool and tier model apply at every scale;
only the scope of the run changes.

## 3. The Pipeline

```
CORPUS (score existing networks) → RUBRIC CALIBRATES → GAP MAP
  → CONCEPT → SCORE → PARLIAMENT → DESIGN → HANDOFF
```

**Anchor rule**: one existing element must go through the full pipeline (corpus entry →
calibration pass → gap-map entry) before any proposed project is analyzed. One proposed
project must survive parliament manually before any skill is built. YAGNI is the law.

## 4. Quality Bar

- Research-paper-level estimates. Order-of-magnitude operations, delay, capacity, and cost
  figures with citations.
- Every number cited. An uncited number blocks promotion to `validated`.
- No capacity or delay claim dressed as solved engineering — conceptual analysis only,
  with evidence labels and the demand basis named (peak/IMC vs average/VMC).
- No hand-waving on economics. Marginal or negative benefit-cost projects are reported as
  such.
- Data sources declared. Every corpus entry names its source (`data/sources.md`).

## 5. Forbidden Vocabulary

In corpus entries and design proposals: no "obviously needed," "critical gap," "long
overdue," or any pre-judged framing before the score supports it. Claims must cite (a)
dimension, (b) score, (c) corpus comparison, (d) scale. "This airport scores 8.4 on Delay
vs. a corpus mean of 5.1 at national scale" beats "this is a critical bottleneck."

## 6. VTRACE Governance

TARMAC's planning baseline lives in `docs/vtrace/` and is authored one deliverable at a
time to a `.roles` review fixed point. Do not start implementation code until the relevant
work package is accepted.

## 7. Review Panel

Seven adversarial parliament voices and a three-role editorial gate review every
promotable artifact. See `.roles/ROLE.md`. No voice is skipped. The slot-and-hub realist
exists because airport slots, gates, and fortress-hub control gate what can actually fly —
that market tension is a feature, not an accident.

## 8. Portfolio Discipline

TARMAC implementation changes belong in this repo. TRACKER receives only intentional
submodule pointer updates after intake. Do not make build or validation correctness depend
on TRACKER-relative paths.
