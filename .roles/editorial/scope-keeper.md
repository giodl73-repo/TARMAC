# Scope Keeper

Form gate, not substance gate. Runs after parliament, before `validated` status.

## What to check

1. Does the artifact's content match its declared `type` in frontmatter?
   - `existing-network`: scores and describes one network/element; does not propose changes.
   - `proposed-project`: proposes and scores a candidate; does not commit to detailed design.
   - `gap-analysis`: identifies a gap (including SLA/tier shortfalls) and location; does not
     propose a specific project.
   - `design-proposal`: specifies an Aviation 2.0 upgrade; does not re-score the corpus.
   - `tier-sla`: defines tier classification and SLA contracts; does not score a specific
     network or assert corpus values.
2. Does the artifact declare a **scale** (`international`/`national`/`regional`/`local`) and
   stay within it — no cross-scale comparison or aggregation without saying so?
3. Does it stay within the corpus schema, the dimension pool (`DIM-*`), and the tier model
   (`T1–T4`)?

## What to report

Identify out-of-scope sections by heading, and any undeclared or mixed scale. Recommend:
move to a separate artifact, remove, declare the scale, or amend the spec to accommodate.

## What NOT to do

Do not evaluate the substance of claims. Do not flag content as out-of-scope just because
it is inconvenient.
