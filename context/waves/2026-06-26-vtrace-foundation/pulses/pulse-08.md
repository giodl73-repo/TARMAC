# Pulse 08: ARCHITECTURE

Settled. Authored `docs/vtrace/ARCHITECTURE.md`: 7 components (tarmac-network / corpus / score
/ tier / gap / cli + docs review layer), scale allocated to the corpus and gap layers,
downward-only dependency direction, data flow, dependencies, and failure modes (incl.
demand-basis-unknown and scheduled-as-actual → hold/label). Fixed point: removed a potential
`corpus→score` cycle. Next: INTERFACES.
