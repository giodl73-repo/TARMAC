# Pulse 01: MISSION baseline

## Goal

Author `docs/vtrace/MISSION.md` — the leftmost VTRACE artifact for TARMAC — and drive it to
a `.roles` review fixed point. One VTRACE deliverable only.

## Changes

- Bootstrap repo identity: `README.md`, `PRODUCT_PLAN.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`,
  `.gitignore`.
- Establish the review panel: `.roles/` (7 parliament voices incl. the slot-and-hub
  realist, 3 editorial roles, 5 stakeholder lenses, peer panel).
- Author `docs/vtrace/MISSION.md` with `NEED-001..008` (incl. T1–T4 tier SLAs and
  multi-scale applicability), `CON-001..007` (incl. scale discipline), users, operating
  context, non-goals, success criteria.

## Role review (real `.roles` panel)

| Role | Disposition | Note |
|---|---|---|
| Scope Keeper / Citation Auditor / Numeracy Checker | pass | No scores/quantities; multi-scale rule named. |
| Aviation System Planner | pass | Connectivity + tiering + multi-scale intent present. |
| Operations & ATC Officer | pass | Demand-basis framing required (NEED-002/003). |
| Regional-Access & Environmental advocates | pass | Small-community access + noise/emissions first-class. |
| Slot-and-Hub Realist | finding → resolved | Added Slot/hub user lens + CON-006 determination boundary. |

Fixed point: 1 minor finding raised and applied; no unresolved critical/major finding.
Deferred: dimension pool, rubric, tier SLA thresholds, demand method, scale-tagging schema
to REQUIREMENTS/SPEC.

## Validation

- `git diff --check`
- `proof check .`

## Status

Settled. Next stage: CONOPS (`pulse-02`).
