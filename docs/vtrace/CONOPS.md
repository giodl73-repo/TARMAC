# Concept of Operations

## Scope

Repo: TARMAC

VTRACE adoption scope: describe the operating scenarios that TARMAC's requirements and
specification baseline must preserve. CONOPS is the bridge from mission needs
(`MISSION.md`) to observable repo workflows. It asserts no scores, gaps, or projects.
TARMAC is greenfield, so these scenarios describe intended operation, and each names the
mission need it serves. Every scenario is **scale-aware**.

## Actors

| Actor | Responsibility | Needs |
|---|---|---|
| TARMAC maintainer | Own repo truth, active goal, generated artifacts, and promotion posture at a stated scale. | Clear commands, evidence labels, review gates, scoped child-repo changes. |
| Coding agent | Make bounded changes to corpus, data, docs, and (later) code from accepted work packages. | Parent `NEED-*`/`REQ-*`/`WP-*` IDs, affected surfaces, validation commands, stop conditions. |
| Review steward | Run `.roles` review lanes; record changes to claims, holds, labels, or next steps. | Mission/requirement IDs, review scope, scale, artifacts to inspect. |
| Aviation analyst | Inspect corpus scores, gap maps, and design options at a chosen scale. | Reproducible artifacts with source, confidence, evidence posture, and scale. |
| Data steward | Maintain `data/sources.md` and source/proxy/heuristic label discipline. | Stable source identifiers, update cadence, citation rules. |
| Stakeholder reviewer | Apply planner, engineer, operations, economist, access, environmental, and slot-hub lenses. | Claims that name demand, delay basis, resilience, access, and slot/hub posture. |

## Scenarios

### OPS-001: Add And Score An Existing Network (serves NEED-001, NEED-002, NEED-004, NEED-008)

Trigger: a maintainer or agent adds an existing air-network element to the corpus.

Inputs: public source data (BTS / FAA / OpenFlights), the dimension pool, the corpus
schema, `data/sources.md`, and the element's **scale** and market.

Normal path:

1. Create one corpus file with a stable airport/route/network identifier and a declared
   `scale` (international/national/regional/local).
2. Populate dimension values, each citing a source or labelled proxy/heuristic.
3. Score the element against the calibrated rubric, interpreted within its scale.
4. Record source, confidence, scale, and evidence labels on every quantity.

Failure or degraded path: if a source or the scale is missing, the row remains held with a
source-needed label and a next evidence step; it is not filled with uncited prose or an
assumed scale.

Outputs: one scored corpus entry with preserved labels and declared scale.

Handoffs: maintainer to review steward when evidence posture changes.

Validation evidence: PROOF/doc checks, source-label inspection, future `EVID-*`.

### OPS-002: Calibrate The Rubric (serves NEED-002, NEED-005)

Trigger: enough networks are scored to test which dimensions differentiate.

Inputs: scored corpus, dimension pool, variance/correlation review (within scale).

Normal path:

1. Inspect per-dimension variance and cross-dimension correlation.
2. Retire low-variance or redundant axes; promote informative ones.
3. Bump the rubric version and record the rationale.

Failure or degraded path: if the corpus is too small or unbalanced, the pass is deferred
and the limitation recorded rather than forcing a change.

Outputs: a versioned rubric and a calibration record.

Handoffs: maintainer to analyst and review steward.

Validation evidence: calibration record, rubric version diff, future `EVID-*`.

### OPS-003: Build The Gap Map And Surface A Candidate (serves NEED-002, NEED-006)

Trigger: the calibrated corpus is plotted to find under-served regions.

Inputs: scored corpus, calibrated rubric, gap-analysis method, chosen scale.

Normal path:

1. Plot scored networks in the dimension space at the chosen scale.
2. Identify under-served regions (e.g. high delay + slot-constrained capacity + low
   resilience).
3. Record candidate gaps with the dimensions, corpus comparison, and scale that define
   them.

Failure or degraded path: if a system is already fluid, connected, and accessible, that
null result is recorded as a finding (NEED-006), not manufactured into a gap.

Outputs: gap-map artifact and candidate-gap records, or a recorded null result.

Handoffs: maintainer to design author.

Validation evidence: gap artifact, reproduction command, future `TRACE.md`.

### OPS-004: Review And Promote Or Hold A Design Claim (serves NEED-003, NEED-005)

Trigger: a conceptual Aviation 2.0 project/feature package is proposed for downstream use.

Inputs: the proposal, evidence labels, scale, parliament/editorial lenses, non-goal
constraints from `MISSION.md`.

Normal path:

1. Confirm the claim carries an evidence label and a declared scale.
2. Run the 7-voice parliament; require each voice to challenge or accept — including the
   slot-and-hub realist on any slot/gate/overbuild assumption.
3. Run the 3-role editorial gate (citation, scope incl. scale, numeracy).
4. Promote only the bounded claim; keep construction readiness, slot/route determination,
   and endorsement out of scope.

Failure or degraded path: if evidence, review, or scope is insufficient, the claim stays
held or downgraded with a next evidence step.

Outputs: promoted, held, or downgraded claim plus a review record.

Handoffs: review steward to maintainer or design owner.

Validation evidence: review record, editorial-gate result, future `EVID-*`.

### OPS-005: Apply VTRACE One Deliverable At A Time (serves all NEEDs)

Trigger: a maintainer asks to advance TARMAC's VTRACE baseline.

Inputs: existing `docs/vtrace/` artifacts, `.roles`, VTRACE templates, the active wave
ledger.

Normal path:

1. Create or revise exactly one VTRACE deliverable.
2. Use prior VTRACE IDs as parent IDs.
3. Review against the relevant `.roles` subset to a fixed point.
4. Run doc validation; record the stage in the wave ledger.
5. Commit the child repo only when the stage is settled and validated.

Failure or degraded path: if repo state is dirty or out of scope, keep edits scoped to the
one deliverable and report status.

Outputs: one reviewed VTRACE artifact with stable IDs.

Handoffs: maintainer to next-stage author.

Validation evidence: `git diff --check`, PROOF check, role review notes.

### OPS-006: Classify Tier And Check SLA Conformance (serves NEED-007, NEED-002)

Trigger: a network is added or re-evaluated, or a market's adequacy is assessed.

Inputs: element attributes (role, operations, runways, hub status), the T1–T4 tier model,
and the per-tier SLA contract.

Normal path:

1. Classify the element into T1 (International Gateway Hub), T2 (National Hub), T3 (Regional
   Airport), or T4 (Local/General Aviation).
2. Look up the tier's SLA (capacity, delay, connectivity, access).
3. Assess conformance: does the element meet its tier SLA, with the demand basis named
   (peak/IMC vs average/VMC, REQ-007)?
4. Record a tier-SLA gap where the element under-serves its tier promise.

Failure or degraded path: if tier or SLA inputs are missing, the element is held with a
source-needed label rather than assigned a tier on assumption.

Outputs: a tier label, an SLA-conformance assessment, and any tier-SLA gap.

Handoffs: maintainer to gap author and review steward.

Validation evidence: tier/SLA record, conformance check, future `EVID-*`.

### OPS-007: Run Analysis At A Chosen Scale (serves NEED-008)

Trigger: a maintainer scopes a corpus, gap, or design run to a scale.

Inputs: the scored corpus tagged by scale, the chosen scale
(international/national/regional/local), and the market/jurisdiction filter.

Normal path:

1. Select the scale and market/jurisdiction for the run.
2. Filter the corpus to elements at (or relevant to) that scale.
3. Score, gap, or design strictly within the scale; do not aggregate across scales.
4. If a cross-scale relationship matters (e.g. a national hub gap affecting a regional
   market), record it as an explicit, labelled cross-scale note (CON-007).

Failure or degraded path: if elements lack a scale tag, they are excluded and flagged, not
silently mixed in.

Outputs: a scale-scoped corpus/gap/design view with any cross-scale notes.

Handoffs: maintainer to analyst and review steward.

Validation evidence: scale-filtered artifact, future `EVID-*`.

## Operational Assumptions

- TARMAC is greenfield: VTRACE is authored ahead of implementation, so scenarios describe
  intended operation, not retrofit.
- The active VTRACE sequence is MISSION → CONOPS → REQUIREMENTS → SPECIFICATION_BASELINE
  before implementation planning.
- Some data sources may be expensive, lagged, or schedule-vs-actual ambiguous; TARMAC
  records intended acquisition and validation even when a full pass is deferred.
- `.roles` review is part of TARMAC operations and must change evidence posture, claim
  labels, or next steps when it finds a gap.
- TRACKER remains the portfolio snapshot repo; TARMAC owns repo-local implementation and
  VTRACE artifacts.

## Role Review Notes

| Role Lens | CONOPS Impact | Disposition |
|---|---|---|
| Scope Keeper | Scenarios describe workflows; no specific network/gap/design prescribed; OPS-007 enforces scale scoping. | pass |
| Citation Auditor | No new quantitative claims; scenarios name repo-local artifacts and future evidence paths. | pass |
| Numeracy Checker | No arithmetic, units, score ranges, delay, or cost figures. | pass |
| Aviation Planner / Operations Officer | Scoring and review scenarios require demand-basis evidence before promotion. | pass |
| Slot-and-Hub Realist | OPS-004 explicitly requires the realist to challenge slot/gate/overbuild assumptions. | pass |
| Data steward (added lens) | Initial draft underspecified source-label and scale custody; resolved by adding the Data steward actor and the source-needed/scale hold path in OPS-001. | resolved |

Fixed-point note: one actionable finding (source-label/scale custody under-specified) was
raised and applied. No unresolved critical or major finding remains.

## Open Questions

| ID | Question | Disposition |

| OQ-002 | Which data sources become the first `EVID-*` sources, and at what cadence? | Defer to `data/sources.md` and `VERIFICATION.md`. |
| OQ-003 | What demand basis (peak/IMC vs average/VMC) anchors capacity/delay scoring? | Defer to `SPECIFICATION_BASELINE.md`. |
| OQ-004 | How is the `scale` tag represented and enforced in the corpus schema? | Defer to `SPECIFICATION_BASELINE.md` / `INTERFACES.md`. |
