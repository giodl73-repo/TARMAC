# Trace Matrix

## Scope

Repo: TARMAC

VTRACE adoption scope: connect TARMAC's accepted requirements to mission needs, CONOPS
scenarios, controlled specification items, future design surfaces, work packages,
verification, validation, and evidence. TARMAC is greenfield: design elements, work
packages, and evidence are **planned/deferred**, and this matrix exposes those gaps honestly
rather than implying built surfaces exist.

## Cross-Stage Coverage

| Source Stage | IDs Covered | Downstream Stage | Coverage Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Mission needs | NEED-001..008 | REQ-001..016 | covered | Every need drives one or more requirements; NEED-007 → REQ-014/015; NEED-008 → REQ-005/016. |
| Mission constraints | CON-001..007 | REQ-001..016 | covered | Constraints attached where they affect evidence, identity, scope, repo ops, or scale. |
| CONOPS scenarios | OPS-001..007 | REQ-001..016 | covered | Every scenario drives at least one accepted requirement. |
| Requirements | REQ-001..016 | SPEC-001..013 / SPEC-NF-001..003 / IF-001..004 | covered | Specification coverage accepted in `SPECIFICATION_BASELINE.md`. |
| Specifications | SPEC-001..013 | `VER-*` / `EVID-*` | planned | Verification IDs defined in `VERIFICATION.md`; evidence is greenfield-pending. |
| Requirements / specs | REQ-* / SPEC-* | `WP-*` | deferred | No work packages yet; implementation planning follows the minimum slice. |

## Unknowns And Deferrals Trace

| ID | Item | Downstream Owner | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| DEF-001 | Dimension pool definitions + weights. | `SPECIFICATION_BASELINE` (pool defined, weights calibrate) / corpus wave | partially closed (pool DIM-01..13 defined; weights deferred) |
| DEF-002 | Actual (BTS/ASPM) vs scheduled delay modelling. | `SPECIFICATION_BASELINE` (SPEC-DB-02) | deferred |
| DEF-003 | Data-source acquisition + cadence. | `data/sources.md` / `VERIFICATION` | deferred |
| DEF-004 | Implementation interfaces (CLI, schema, crates). | `ARCHITECTURE` / `INTERFACES` | deferred |
| DEF-005 | Scale as flat tag vs nested hierarchy. | `SPECIFICATION_BASELINE` (SCALE-03) / `INTERFACES` | deferred |
| SPEC-UNK-001 | Cross-scale data openness for DIM-01/03/06. | data steward | discovery |
| SPEC-UNK-002 | Scheduled-vs-actual / VMC-vs-IMC for DIM-02/03. | operations reviewer | accept risk (proxy) |
| SPEC-UNK-003 | Benefit-cost basis for DIM-12. | aviation economist | defer to calibration |
| SPEC-UNK-004 | Per-tier SLA thresholds (DIM-13). | TARMAC maintainer | defer to calibration |
| SPEC-UNK-005 | Scale nesting representation. | TARMAC maintainer | defer (DEF-005) |

## Honest Gaps (no faked evidence)

- No `VER-*` evidence exists yet; verification methods are named but unrun. The next stage
  (`VERIFICATION.md`) defines `VER-*`; actual `EVID-*` accrue only once implementation work
  packages run.
- No `WP-*`, `ARCHITECTURE`, `INTERFACES`, or `CODE_RIGOR` artifacts exist yet; the trace
  marks these `deferred`, not satisfied.
- Dimension weights, SLA thresholds, and scale nesting are provisional; the trace does not
  claim calibrated values.

## Role Review Notes

| Role Lens | Trace Impact | Disposition |
|---|---|---|
| Scope Keeper | Trace links IDs only; asserts no score or design; REQ-016 scale traced. | pass |
| Citation Auditor | No quantities; evidence pointers are future or repo-local. | pass |
| Numeracy Checker | No arithmetic. | pass |
| Requirements-traceability lens | Every accepted REQ maps to a need/scenario and a spec; coverage gaps are labelled, not hidden. | pass |
| Operations & ATC Officer | REQ-007/REQ-015 trace the demand basis and tier-SLA gating through SPEC-005/SPEC-012. | pass |
| Aviation Planner | NEED-007/008 trace cleanly to REQ-014/015/016 and SPEC-011/012/013. | pass |

Fixed-point note: no actionable finding required a change; the matrix's value is exposing the
greenfield gaps (no `WP-*`/`EVID-*` yet), recorded as `deferred`/`planned` rather than
fabricated. No unresolved critical/major finding.
